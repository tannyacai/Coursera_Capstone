As the area continues to expand its growing biotech and healthcare presence, its academic and research institutions, and beautiful coastal views and beachside activities, there will be increasing interest from investors and developers in understanding the distribution of venues in the region, and how that can impact opportunities for new buildings and businesses, especially hotels for visiting travelers, in the area. \n\nThe goal here is to identify where the most optimal neighborhoods to buy or build a hotel, with the intention of being in an area with the least number of hotels as possible, and overlaying areas with the number of tourist attractions in the region.
