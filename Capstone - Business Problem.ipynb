As the area continues to expand its growing healthcare and finance presence, its academic and research institutions, and lively city life, there will be increasing interest from investors and developers in understanding the distribution of venues in the region, and how that can impact opportunities for new buildings and businesses, especially hotels for visiting travelers, in the area. \n\nThe goal here is to identify where the most optimal neighborhoods to buy or build a hotel, with the intention of being in an area with the least number of hotels as possible, and overlaying areas with the number of venues and attractions in the region. \n\nAudience: This analysis is intended for investors and developers who are interested in gaining a deeper view of where might be optimal locations for starting up a hotel business, especially in the context of surrounding venues and attractions."

Additionally, hotel data can be pulled from the Foursquare API as well to understand distribution of hotels around the GTA."
